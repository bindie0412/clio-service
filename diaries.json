I decided to call an old friend I hadn't spoken to in months. Our conversation flowed so easily—full of laughter and shared memories—and it completely lifted my spirits.

I was literally jumping around the apartment, screaming with pure, unadulterated joy. I felt like I was floating on air, completely invincible, and spent the entire afternoon texting everyone and planning the move. Later, as I settled down and looked out the window, I noticed something strange across the street: a light flickering rapidly in the top window of the old, abandoned house. It wasn't just blinking; it seemed frantic. I dismissed it at first, attributing it to the cold, but then I saw a shadow—tall, thin, and definitely not static—pass behind the glass. My heart instantly dropped from its peak of happiness into a pit of icy dread.

The village had changed a lot over time. Uncertain, \r\nshe awkwardly looked around at her surroundings. She walked \r\nthe narrow streets of the village, unsure about which way to \r\ngo. Suddenly, Sophie saw a familiar sight. “Yes, this must be \r\nit,” she thought. In front of her was a wall with flowers painted \r\non it. Although the colors were now faded, the familiar shapes \r\non the wall were the same ones she had painted with her father \r\nas a child. Sophie nodded, smiled brightly, and walked toward \r\nthe gate. At last, she had finally found the house she had \r\ngrown up in.",
